<h1>Hi! 👋</h1>
<h2>My name is James Boullion</h2>

💻 I am a fullstack developer from Madison, WI who loves to work on a little bit of everything.

🚀 I volunteer with [Nexus Aurora](https://nexusaurora.org/) to provide software development and IT expertise. We are a community based organization which incubates projects with a focus on space settlement and education.  

🛸 I run a site called [Space Calcs](https://spacecalcs.com/) with various tools and calculators for learning about important concepts in space.

📊 I have started work on a new set of sites focused on providing useful calculators for a variety of use cases, tentatively called "Simple Calcs"


☢️ Currently developing: 
- Simple Calcs (TBD): A set of sites which will provide a wide variety of everyday useful calculators
- [NA Academy](https://naacademy.netlify.app/): Helping students and and enthusiasts learn about a variety of space topics
- [Semiconductor Radiation Toolkit](https://rad-toolkit.nexusaurora.org/): Helping engineers find semiconductor parts for aerospace products. Data compiled by [@codeflight1](https://github.com/codeflight1) 
- [Space Race](https://space-race.nexusaurora.org/): Tracking the progress of rockets, agencies, and nations on the race to space! Data provided by [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com/)


🎮 I love to play around with Unreal Engine, Blender, Three.js, and Roblox Development when I get the chance!
