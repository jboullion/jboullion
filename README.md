##  Hi! 👋
### My name is James Boullion

💻 I am a full stack developer who loves to work on a little bit of everything.

💼 In my day job I work for an agency that mostly works with a large E-Commerce client on a .NET and Vue stack. 

👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 I have a lovely wife and two young daughters so I spend most of my time with them.

⏳ When I have free time I like to work on all sorts of things!

🚀 I am the IT director at [Nexus Aurora](https://nexusaurora.org/). We are a volunteer organization which incubates open source projects with a focus on human space settlement.

☀️ I work with [RENEW Wisconsin](https://www.renewwisconsin.org/) to help them achive their goals of enacting government legislation to further the growth of renewable energy in my home state.

🎮 I love to play around with Unreal Engine, Blender, and ThreeJS when I get the chance!

🥕 I like to garden, cook, and do resistance exercises...with the little time I have left!

♟️ I also recently started learning chess!

🎲 Currently my favorite stack is all Typescript with a Vue based front end and Express.js based backend. Check out one of my recent toys I made to experiment with this stack: [Emoji Games](https://emojis.jboullion.com/)!
