<h1>Hi! 👋</h1>
<h2>My name is James Boullion</h2>

👾 I also run a site called [Simple Games](https://simple-games.fun/) which hosts a variety of fun simple games. This is mostly a playground for me to make fun games an experiment with web technologies

🛸 I also run a site called [Space Calcs](https://spacecalcs.com/) with various tools and calculators for learning about and estimating important problems in space.
