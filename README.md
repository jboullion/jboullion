##  Hi! 👋
### My name is James Boullion

💻 I am a full stack developer who loves to work on a little bit of everything.

🚀 I am the IT director at [Nexus Aurora](https://nexusaurora.org/). We are a volunteer organization which incubates open source projects with a focus on human space settlement. I also made a [couple of tools](https://nexusaurora.org/calculators/) to help people understand important space concepts.

☀️ I work with [RENEW Wisconsin](https://www.renewwisconsin.org/) to help them achive their goals of enacting government legislation to further the growth of renewable energy in my home state.

🎮 I love to play around with Unreal Engine, Blender, and ThreeJS when I get the chance!

🎲 Currently my favorite stack is all Typescript with a Vue based front end and Express.js based backend. Check out one of my recent toys I made to experiment with this stack: [Emoji Games](https://emoji-games.herokuapp.com/)!
