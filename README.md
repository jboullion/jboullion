<h1>Hi! 👋</h1>
<h2>My name is James Boullion</h2>

💻 I am a front and back end developer who loves to work on a little bit of everything.

🚀 I volunteer as the IT director at [Nexus Aurora](https://nexusaurora.org/). We are a volunteer organization which incubates open source projects with a focus on human space settlement.

☀️ I work with [RENEW Wisconsin](https://www.renewwisconsin.org/), and other renewable energy non-profits, to help them achive their goals of enacting government legislation to further the growth of renewable energy in my home state.

🛸 I run a site called [Space Calcs](https://spacecalcs.com/) with various tools and calculators for learning about important concepts in space. 

☢️ Currently developing: 
- [Semiconductor Radiation Toolkit](https://rad-toolkit.nexusaurora.org/): Helping engineers find semiconductor parts for aerospace products. Data compiled by [@codeflight1](https://github.com/codeflight1) 
- [Space Race](https://space-race.nexusaurora.org/): Tracking the progress of rockets, agencies, and nations on the race to space! Data provided by [The Space Devs](https://thespacedevs.com/)


🎮 I love to play around with Unreal Engine, Blender, and ThreeJS when I get the chance!
