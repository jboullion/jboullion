##  Hi! 👋
### My name is James Boullion

💻 I am a full stack developer who loves to work on a little bit of everything.

🚀 I am the IT director at [Nexus Aurora](https://nexusaurora.org/). We are a volunteer organization which incubates open source projects with a focus on human space settlement.

☀️ I work with [RENEW Wisconsin](https://www.renewwisconsin.org/) to help them achive their goals of enacting government legislation to further the growth of renewable energy in my home state.

🛸 I run a site called [Space Calcs](https://space-calcs.netlify.app/) with various tools and calculators for learning about important concepts in space. 

🎲 A recent project I have been tinkering with is [Emoji Games](https://emoji-games.up.railway.app/). A place to create fun little games and experiment with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).

🎮 I love to play around with Unreal Engine, Blender, and ThreeJS when I get the chance!
